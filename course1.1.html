    <h4 class="right">Proving triangle congruence involves demonstrating that two triangles are identical in shape and size, using various methods based on their sides and angles. One fundamental approach is the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion, where two triangles share two sides and the angle between them. Similarly, the Side-Side-Side (SSS) criterion states that all corresponding sides of two triangles are equal. Additionally, the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) criterion requires two triangles to have two angles and the included side congruent. To establish triangle congruence, one can use these criteria alongside postulates like the Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) and Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) theorems in right triangles. Employing these methods rigorously ensures precise geometric proofs, essential in fields like engineering and architecture where accuracy and consistency are paramount.</h4>
